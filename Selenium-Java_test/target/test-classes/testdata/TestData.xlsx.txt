This is a placeholder for the Excel file. In a real project, you would create an Excel file with the following structure:

Sheet: AmazonSearch
Columns:
- SearchKeyword
- ProductIndex
- ExpectedTitle

Sample data:
1. tshirt, 0, tshirt
2. shoes, 1, shoes
3. watch, 2, watch

Sheet: AmazonProduct
Columns:
- ProductName
- Quantity
- ExpectedPrice

Sample data:
1. tshirt, 2, 500
2. shoes, 1, 1000
3. watch, 1, 2000

To use this data, create an Excel file with the above structure and save it as TestData.xlsx in the src/test/resources/testdata/ directory.
